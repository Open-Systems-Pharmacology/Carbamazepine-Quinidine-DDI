# Carbamazepine-Quinidine-DDI
Modeling of published carbamazepine-quinidine-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot and a PK-Sim model file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the quinidine model regarding carbamazepine-quinidine-DDIs, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied carbamazepine model has been published previously [1]. For further details and documentation please refer to [2].
